# Duplicate Entries Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The frontend was creating duplicate entries in the database (enterprises, products, services) because it was using a flawed logic:

1. **Always try to create first** → This could succeed and create duplicates
2. **Fallback to find existing** → This was unreliable and didn't prevent duplicates
3. **Same names stored multiple times** → Different IDs for the same names

## Root Cause

The original logic was:
```javascript
// WRONG APPROACH
try {
    // Always try to create first
    const response = await api.post('/api/enterprises', { name: name });
    enterpriseId = response.id;
} catch (error) {
    // Only fallback if creation fails
    const existing = await findExisting();
    enterpriseId = existing.id;
}
```

This approach was problematic because:
- The creation might succeed (creating a duplicate)
- The fallback might not work properly
- Multiple refreshes would create multiple entries

## Solution Implemented

### New Logic: Check First, Then Create

```javascript
// CORRECT APPROACH
// 1. Always check for existing first
const enterprises = await api.get('/api/enterprises');
const existing = enterprises.find(e => e.name.toLowerCase() === name.toLowerCase());

if (existing) {
    // 2. Use existing if found
    enterpriseId = existing.id;
} else {
    // 3. Only create if not found
    const response = await api.post('/api/enterprises', { name: name });
    enterpriseId = response.id;
}
```

### Changes Made

1. **Enterprise Creation Logic**:
   - ✅ Check existing enterprises first
   - ✅ Use existing ID if found
   - ✅ Only create new if not found

2. **Product Creation Logic**:
   - ✅ Check existing products first
   - ✅ Use existing ID if found
   - ✅ Only create new if not found

3. **Service Creation Logic**:
   - ✅ Check existing services first
   - ✅ Use existing ID if found
   - ✅ Only create new if not found

### Files Modified

- **`src/components/EnterpriseConfigTable.tsx`**:
  - Fixed `saveDraft` function
  - Fixed `scheduleSaveForEnterprise` function
  - Updated all entity creation logic

## Expected Behavior

After this fix:

1. **No more duplicates**: Same names will reuse existing IDs
2. **Consistent data**: Each unique name will have only one ID
3. **Proper relationships**: Enterprise-product-service relationships will use correct IDs
4. **No data loss**: Existing data remains intact

## Database Impact

- **Existing duplicates**: Will remain in the database (you may want to clean them up)
- **New entries**: Will only be created if the name doesn't exist
- **Relationships**: Will use the correct existing IDs

## Testing

1. **Add a new row** with existing enterprise/product/service names
2. **Check database** - should reuse existing IDs, not create duplicates
3. **Refresh page** - should not create new entries
4. **Add same names again** - should reuse existing entries

## Console Messages

Look for these success messages:
```
Enterprise product service relationship created successfully in new table
Enterprise relationships saved successfully
```

No more duplicate creation warnings should appear.

## Database Cleanup (Optional)

If you want to clean up existing duplicates, you can run SQL queries like:

```sql
-- Find duplicate enterprises
SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM enterprises GROUP BY name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Find duplicate products  
SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM products GROUP BY name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Find duplicate services
SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM services GROUP BY name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

Then manually remove the duplicates, keeping the ones that are referenced in the relationships table.
