# Frontend Data Loading Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The frontend was not properly loading and displaying data from the `systiva.fnd_enterprise_products_services` table. The data was being saved correctly in the backend, but the frontend wasn't fetching and resolving the IDs to names properly.

## Root Cause

1. **Wrong API endpoint**: The frontend was trying to use a `/detailed` endpoint that might not exist
2. **Missing name resolution**: The frontend wasn't fetching names from the respective tables (`fnd_enterprises`, `fnd_products`, `fnd_services`)
3. **Incomplete data processing**: The conversion logic wasn't properly handling the relationship data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Data Loading Logic

The `loadEnterpriseProductServices` function now:

1. **Fetches relationships** from `/api/enterprise-products-services`
2. **Fetches names** from the respective tables:
   - `/api/enterprises` for enterprise names
   - `/api/products` for product names  
   - `/api/services` for service names
3. **Resolves IDs to names** using lookup maps
4. **Converts to Enterprise[] format** for the table component

### 2. Complete Data Flow

```
1. GET /api/enterprise-products-services
   ↓ Returns: [{id: 2, enterpriseId: 1, productId: 1, serviceId: 1}, ...]

2. GET /api/enterprises
   ↓ Returns: [{id: 1, name: "SAP"}, {id: 13, name: "Test Enterprise"}, ...]

3. GET /api/products  
   ↓ Returns: [{id: 1, name: "eeee"}, {id: 12, name: "Test Product"}, ...]

4. GET /api/services
   ↓ Returns: [{id: 1, name: "sfsfsdfsdfs"}, {id: 6, name: "Test Service"}, ...]

5. Resolve names and convert to table format
   ↓ Creates: [{id: "1", name: "SAP", services: [{id: "1", name: "eeee", categories: ["sfsfsdfsdfs"]}]}]
```

### 3. Automatic Refresh

The frontend now:
- ✅ Loads data on page load (useEffect)
- ✅ Refreshes after creating new relationships
- ✅ Refreshes after deleting relationships
- ✅ Refreshes after editing existing relationships

## Expected Behavior

After these fixes, when you:

1. **Refresh the page** → Should load all existing relationships from the database
2. **Add a new row** → Should create the relationship and refresh the table
3. **Edit existing data** → Should update the relationship and refresh the table
4. **Delete data** → Should remove the relationship and refresh the table

## Console Messages to Look For

**Success messages**:
```
Loaded data from enterprise_products_services table with resolved names
Enterprise product service relationship created successfully in new table
```

**No more fallback warnings**:
```
New enterprise_products_services table not available, falling back to legacy enterprises
```

## Database Verification

Based on your database screenshot, the table contains:
- Row 2: enterprise_id=1, product_id=1, service_id=1
- Row 3: enterprise_id=16, product_id=15, service_id=8
- Row 4: enterprise_id=17, product_id=16, service_id=9
- ... and more

The frontend should now properly display these relationships with their resolved names.

## Testing Steps

1. **Open browser console**
2. **Go to Enterprise Configuration page**
3. **Check console for success messages**
4. **Verify data is displayed in the table**
5. **Try adding a new row** and verify it persists
6. **Refresh the page** and verify data loads correctly

## Files Modified

- **`src/app/account-settings/enterprise-configuration/page.tsx`**:
  - Updated `loadEnterpriseProductServices` function
  - Fixed data processing and name resolution
  - Improved error handling and fallback logic
